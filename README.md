## Current Repo Version 2.4.23

This is a mirror of the GF Core plugin, with the addition of a **'Does Not Contain'** conditional. 

### _Why copy the plugin?_

The static methods of the Core plugin make building an extension plugin more difficult than I felt like dealing with to get the extra (and much needed) conditional. 

If you want to use this in production, your best bet is to probably fork and make updates through composer and/or keep it in mu-plugins directory.
